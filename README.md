# Password Generator

### Description:

- This app generates passwords.

- There should be a "Generate Password!" button which the user can click to show a new random password. 

- By **default**, the password generated should use **mixed cases** (both lowercase and uppercase).

---

### Instructions:

Create a password generator app with the following instructions:

1. Create your page layout in HTML.

2. Add an event listener to your "Generate Password!" button. This should execute a function every time the button is clicked.

3. Use the constant "charset" in your function (move it there). It contains all characters to use.

```javascript
const charset = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!ยง$%&/()=?#,;.:-_';
```

4. Your function should generate a new password. For now, it should be a **default** 20 characters, and use **mixed cases** (both lowercase and uppercase characters). To achieve this in your function, you should ensure that every third character of the generated password should always be uppercase.

```
Examples for generated passwords: - 876FocMkcCv98teXc(Ov (20 characters) - %lfXcrLt-#ke3r6R5ยง-? (20 characters) - Nd1Z\$yRx (9 characters)
```

5. Once the "Generate Password!" button is clicked, your function should execute and immediately fill the content of your "output" field with a randomly generated password.

**Hint:** Remember you can use the following logic to get a random integer (whole number) between a `min` number and a `max` number (inclusive). 

```
Math.random() * (max - min) + min;
```

Perhaps you could apply this to the `charset` variable to pick a random **index** of the variable. Do this 20 times and you should have 20 characters chosen at random...

### Bonus version (only if you finish early!):

1. Add an input field so the user can define the length of the password. After filling in the input field, Clicking the "Generate Password!" button should now generate a new password of the chosen length. If the input field is blank, or has a non-number value, the new password should stay at a default of 20 characters.

2. Add a checkbox to define if the password should use mixed cases. Clicking the "Generate Password!" button will generate a new password with either mixed cases (if the checkbox is checked) or just lowercase (if the checkbox is **not** checked). 

**Hint:** Try to access the "checked" property on your "checkbox" input element in JavaScript (e.g. `myElement.checked`). This should return `true` if the checkbox is checked, and `false` if it is not checked.
